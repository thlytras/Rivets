Description: A collection of some useful R functions that I use to make
    my life a little easier. Some of these functions are intended for
    epidemiologists like me (e.g. epicurve), others are not. All of them
    are standalone, i.e. one can avoid installing the whole package and
    just copy the respective .R script from the package source.
